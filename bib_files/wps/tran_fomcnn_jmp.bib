  abstract = {\textit{Abstract}: This paper shows that financial markets need more time to fully react to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy announcements than typically assumed. Using finance literature techniques and neural network methods for text analysis, I systematically estimate that on average, markets fully react to the information content of FOMC statements within an event window ending at least 30 minutes after release. This optimal window increases with the underlying maturity of an asset, reaching 50--60 minutes in length for maturities at least two quarters ahead. Additionally, statements with greater complexity, less similarity, and dissents are associated with longer event windows on average. I find that the correlation between monetary policy surprises measured within optimal versus 30-minute windows decreases with asset underlying maturity. These differences alter the forward guidance component of monetary policy shocks and magnify their estimated impact on interest rates, break-even inflation, and equity prices. Furthermore, constructing monetary policy shocks within optimal windows results in the responses of macroeconomic variables to become more precise.}
