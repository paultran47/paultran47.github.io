## Overview

The following CSS files are used:

1. [remedy.css](https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy): By Jen Simmons;
similar to Nicolas Gallagher's [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
in the sense that remedy.css tries to "fix" differences in CSS implementation
amongst different browsers. However, remedy.css sets CSS properties or values to
what they would be if the CSSWG were creating the CSS today.

2. [reset.css](https://elad2412.github.io/the-new-css-reset/): By Elad Shechter;
a "modern" take of Eric Meyer's [reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
It's much more lightweight, and is using modern CSS syntax.

3. style.css: Houses all of the core and custom CSS used in building this
website. All critical CSS from this sheet is inlined in the heads of each
individual page. Non-critical CSS can be found exclusively here (critical CSS is
also in this sheet for redundancy's sake).

remedy.css and reset.css are inlined in the head tags to ensure they are loaded
in the correct order. style.css is minified and lazy-loaded without using inline
scripts.
